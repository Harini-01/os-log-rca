# OS-Level Semantic and Metric-Driven Log Root Cause Analysis

This repository contains the implementation of an end-to-end framework for
semantic and metric-driven root cause analysis (RCA) on OS-level system logs.

## Current Focus
- Gap 1: Semantic + Metric-driven Root Cause Analysis

## Dataset
- Linux system logs from LogHub (ISSRE 2023)

## Status
- Phase 1 implementation (dataset-based)
- Real-system validation in progress
